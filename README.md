## About

The News Aggregator is a Python application designed to collect and display news headlines from multiple online sources. It addresses the challenge of staying informed by consolidating information from various websites into a single, easy-to-access interface. This project is ideal for individuals who want a quick overview of current events without having to browse multiple news sites.

This project leverages Python's `requests` library for fetching data and potentially utilizes libraries like `BeautifulSoup4` for parsing HTML content. The architecture involves fetching news data from specified sources, processing the data to extract relevant information (headlines, links), and presenting the information in a user-friendly format, which could be a command-line interface or a simple web interface.

The unique selling point of this aggregator is its simplicity and customizability. Users can easily add or remove news sources to tailor the application to their specific interests. Future enhancements could include features like filtering by keywords, categorizing news by topic, and integrating with notification services.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Clone and run in 3 steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BTW075/News-Aggregator.git
cd News-Aggregator
python main.py
```

This will run the news aggregator and display the latest headlines in your terminal.

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- `pip` (Python package installer)

### Steps

1.  Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BTW075/News-Aggregator.git
```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd News-Aggregator
```

3.  Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4  # Example dependencies, adjust as needed
```

## 💻 Usage

### Basic Usage

To run the news aggregator, simply execute the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will fetch and display the latest news headlines from the configured sources.

### Configuration

The news sources are likely configured within the `main.py` file or a separate configuration file.  You'll need to modify this file to add, remove, or modify the news sources.  Example:

```python
# Example configuration within main.py
news_sources = [
    {"name": "Example News", "url": "https://example.com/news"},
    {"name": "Another News", "url": "https://another-example.com/news"}
]
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Configuration File (Example)

If a separate configuration file is used (e.g., `config.json`):

```json
{
  "news_sources": [
    {
      "name": "Example News",
      "url": "https://example.com/news"
    },
    {
      "name": "Another News",
      "url": "https://another-example.com/news"
    }
  ],
  "settings": {
    "max_headlines": 10
  }
}
```

To use this, you would load the JSON file in your Python code:

```python
import json

with open('config.json', 'r') as f:
    config = json.load(f)

news_sources = config['news_sources']
max_headlines = config['settings']['max_headlines']
```

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please see our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.  (Create this file if you intend to actively manage contributions.)

### Quick Contribution Steps
1. 🍴 Fork the repository
2. 🌟 Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. ✅ Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. 📤 Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)

## Testing

To run tests (if any are included), you would typically use a testing framework like `unittest` or `pytest`.  Example using `unittest`:

1.  Create a `tests/` directory.
2.  Create a test file, e.g., `tests/test_main.py`.

```python
# tests/test_main.py
import unittest
#from main import your_function  # Replace with your actual module

class TestMain(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_something(self):
        self.assertEqual(1, 1) # Example assertion

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Run the tests:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

## Deployment

Deployment will depend on how you want to use the aggregator.

*   **Local Use:** Simply run the `main.py` script as described above.
*   **Web Interface:**  You could integrate the aggregator into a web framework like Flask or Django.
*   **Scheduled Task:** You could schedule the script to run periodically using `cron` (Linux/macOS) or Task Scheduler (Windows).

## FAQ

**Q: How do I add a new news source?**

A:  Edit the `config.json` file (or the `news_sources` list in `main.py`) and add a new entry with the name and URL of the news source.

**Q:  The aggregator is not fetching headlines from a specific source. What should I do?**

A:  Check the URL of the news source.  Ensure that the website is accessible and that the HTML structure has not changed, which might require adjusting the parsing logic in the `main.py` script.
